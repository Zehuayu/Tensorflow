# Tensorflow

## what is Tensorflow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.

## what is keras

Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being minimal, modular and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System), and its primary author and maintainer is Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer.

## question slove
when I :import tensorflow as tf, the result show the tensorflow not define. First of all, I made sure whether install tensorflow. But I did it, finally, when computer install two python, the jupyter notebook could have this error.

## Tensorflow and Keras

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started)TensorFlow provides multiple APIs. The lowest level API--TensorFlow Core-- provides you with complete programming control. We recommend TensorFlow Core for machine learning researchers and others who require fine levels of control over their models. The higher level APIs are built on top of TensorFlow Core. These higher level APIs are typically easier to learn and use than TensorFlow Core. In addition, the higher level APIs make repetitive tasks easier and more consistent between different users. A high-level API like tf.estimator helps you manage data sets, estimators, training and inference.

[Keras](https://keras.io/)Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

## Model picking

Sequential: The model needs to know what input shape it should expect. For this reason, the first layer in a Sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape. There are several possible ways to do this:


## Conclusion

Tensorflow owns too much things to support some application. for example, websites could analysis data by Tensorflow. Deep mind and deep learing enable help people to slove problem in life. making more node increasing correct rate.
