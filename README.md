# Tensorflow

## what is Tensorflow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

## question slove
when I :import tensorflow as tf, the result show the tensorflow not define. First of all, I made sure whether install tensorflow. But I did it, finally, when computer install two python, the jupyter notebook could have this error.

## Conclusion

Tensorflow owns too much things to support some application. for example, websites could analysis data by Tensorflow. Deep mind and deep learing enable help people to slove problem in life. making more node increasing correct rate.
